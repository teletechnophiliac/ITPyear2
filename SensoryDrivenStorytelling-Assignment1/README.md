# ProgAtoZ-LostInTranslation
Assignment 1 for Programming A to Z

The objective of the first assignment was to manually mashup a text, whether through traditional text mashup techniques - text cut ups, n+7, etc - or through a method of our own devising. 

I thought about translation, about how the meaning of words and phrases can get lost as we transfer from language to language. Example: there are phrases in Oriya, the dialect my family speaks in India, that don't translate correctly to English, nor are there equivalents for some English/American English idioms in Oriya. Additionally, auto translation services such as Google Translate don't always get the translations correct - thus, the original piece's meaning can be lost. 

So I decided to mashup different translations of a Japanese song I've loved since high school - the title in English is A Town in Blue, by Asian Kung-Fu Generation. I searched for translations and found two of them, and line by line I alternated between the two to build a mashed up set of lyrics. Frequently I'd get a line-to-line matchup, but sometimes I ran into the problem where the lyrics were rearranged to make sense in English. I was forced to make some alterations, but for the most part I was able to directly alternate lines between translations.
