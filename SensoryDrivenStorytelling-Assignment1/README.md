<b>Narratives where you least expect it</b>: Find examples of storytelling in unusual ways - limited/unusual context. GIF animations, UI feedback, automated help system for a home, airplane safety videos, video games, etc.

<i>Vine</i>

I had no idea you could tell so much story in 6 seconds. Originally, Vine was intended to share videos from your life, but people turned it into a storytelling medium. Film and television have a lot of time to convey a lot. Characters, world building, a premise that has to be compelling to watch for a certain amount of time; all of these require enough time to set up in order to keep the viewer entertained. I would have thought it would be more difficult to do in six seconds, but the most successful ones don't get lost in these details. They create a short plot with the Viner as the star - the most well known ones either play themselves or a dramatized version of themselves, so the viewer is already invested. The ones that I found to be most entertaining were the ones that took an aspect of daily life and riffed on it, but I was mostly just amused at the antics of people on the Internet.

<i>Lifeline (mobile game)</i>

Lifeline is a game that was built for the Apple Watch but can also be played as a mobile game. The game centers around a stranded astronaut named Taylor who you have to help rescue by giving instructions at certain points in the narrative. Where it's different from most mobile games is that it's a game played purely through push notifications - when you as the player have to make a choice, you get to choose between two routes and the story continues based on your choice.

On one hand, condensing dialog down to a push notification is a tough task, something that the game achieves well. On the other, getting a series of these notifications got to be annoying, especially since the game never seemed to quite sync up with my schedule as I was playing it. However, Lifeline had built in breaks to the game to simulate real time passing within the game's world; the protagonist, Taylor, needed to sleep and walk around, so they took the time to do that (similar to how the show <i>24</i> operates). The notifications also made me feel more connected to Taylor, like they (bonus points for the gender ambiguity so the player could decide for themselves) were a friend I was in regular contact with.

In the end, I got to experience the story without any visual help at all. I felt horror, fear, and triumph at the same time as Taylor, but I also felt the pressure to pick correctly as if I were actually rescuing a person. After all, nothing is more vivid than the pictures we paint for ourselves, and I'm still surprised by just how effective the notification mechanic was.
