			Dreams touch upon my pillow as I lie yet to awaken <br />
			<i>A smell of morning makes the city alive </i><br />
			Weather forecast on the screen <br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<i>Day by day, I pray, I seek and scramble</i><br />
			The world Dutch rolls <br />
			<i>The chance meeting you, touching you; your everything is like a magic of love for me,</i><br />
			A city colored in lead gray <br />
			<i>The mice are in the dull blues</i><br />
			A blurry, dull heartbeat <br />
			<i>Only a little bit of white remains in my heart.</i><br />
			<br />
			<br />
			I run, trying to satiate my unfulfilled heart <br />
			<i>Take a step forward and I'll see even the scenery disappears</i><br />
			From up above the sky <br />
			<i>Chasing those whimsical cloud with my eyes, I remember your face</i><br />
			<br />
			<br />
			Sick of it all I gave everything up <br />
			<i>It became black and collapsed</i><br />
			I blotted everything away out of lonesomeness <br />
			<i>Everything became dreadful and I fell in the darkness</i><br />
			<br />
			<br />
			An excursion into another dimension <br />
			<i>The deep, blue night,</i><br />
			Let's change the world <br />
			<i>What are we going to see from there?</i><br />
			<br />
			<br />
			From our opened eyes, we'll collect all that spurts forth <br />
			<i>You and me, let's float them all over the place</i><br />
			Take that plunge and just jump without a run-up <br />
			The velocity of the push off <br />
			<i>At our kicking speed, we can go on forever, I'm sure of it</i><br />
			<br />
			<br />
			I'm sure of it <br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<i>Even light,</i><br />
			Even into the dark... <br />
			<br />
			<i>Surely</i>
			<br />
