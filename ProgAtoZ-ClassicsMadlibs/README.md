<h5>About This Project</h5>
A madlibs game using famous first passages from classic literature. Uses the RiTa JavaScript library.
<h5>Known Bugs</h5>
<ul>
  <li> Sometimes the game rejects words that are the correct part of speech (replicated) - RiTa returns a list of the parts of speech the word can be rather than just the contextual part of speech. In order to fix the bug, a new function would have to be written to determine which part of speech is currently being used for the word.
